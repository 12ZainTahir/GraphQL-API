Fisrt of All, i had to explore Graphql Apis as my knowledge about them was not up to the mark. I feel this is a topic on which i should have spent more time as it is very detailed.

I struggled most at making the connection part because i was first trying to make connection using the pg command and i was giving the wrong port no. Upon some research(stack overflow) i got to know that i have to make sure that the port number in the configuration and the port number in my connection file should be identical.
